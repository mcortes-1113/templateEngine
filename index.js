// * Your app will run as a Node CLI to gather information about each employee.

// * Below is an example of what your application may look like. Remember, the styling is completely up to you so try to make it unique.

// ![Employee Summary 1](./Assets/10-OOP-homework-demo-1)
// ![Employee Summary 2](./Assets/10-OOP-homework-demo-2)

// In the `Develop` folder, there is a `package.json`, so make sure to `npm install`.

// The dependencies are, [jest](https://jestjs.io/) for running the provided tests, and [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) for collecting input from the user.

// There are also unit tests to help you build the classes necessary.

// It is recommended that you follow this workflow:

// 1. Run tests
// 2. Create or update classes to pass a single test case
// 3. Repeat

// ðŸŽ— Remember, you can run the tests at any time with `npm run test`

// It is recommended that you start with a directory structure that looks like this:

// ```
// lib/           // classes and helper code
// output/        // rendered output
// templates/     // HTML template(s)
// test/          // jest tests
//   Employee.test.js
//   Engineer.test.js
//   Intern.test.js
//   Manager.test.js
// app.js         // Runs the application
// ```

// ### Hints

// * Create multiple HTML templates for each type of user. For example, you could use the following templates:

//   * `main.html`

//   * `engineer.html`
  
//   * `intern.html`
  
//   * `manager.html`

// * You will want to make your methods as pure as possible. This means try to make your methods simple so that they are easier to test.

// * The different employee types should all inherit some methods and properties from a base class of `Employee`.

// * In your HTML template files, you may want to add a placeholder character that helps your program identify where the dynamic markup begins and ends.
